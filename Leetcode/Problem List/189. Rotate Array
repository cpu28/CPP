Question:
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105

Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?



Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    void reverse(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            swap(nums[start], nums[end]);
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
    
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        k=k%n; //suppose if k=8 in first example we get same result if do 8 rotations
               // or just one rotation , since size=7 here.
        
        // Reverse the entire array
        reverse(nums, 0, n - 1);
        
        // Reverse the first k elements
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
        
        // Reverse the remaining elements
        reverse(nums, k, n - 1);
    }
};
